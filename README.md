TODO
1. User deletion handleRate() function to be completed. Need to find  X-RateLimit-Reset value and/or investigate superagent has a throttle function
2. Ensure my own account isn't deleted = email !== [myemail]@hotmail.com or have a blacklist of user_id that can never be deleted.
3. Debug deletion 'Not Found' error
4. Move user class from setupHelper and export from userClass.js
5. Decompose helpers to smaller single responsibiliy functions to make extensible for example using strategy patten.
